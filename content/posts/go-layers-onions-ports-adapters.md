Inspired by [layers-onions-ports-adapters-its-all-the-same](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/12/03/layers-onions-ports-adapters-its-all-the-same/), I wanted to put theory/design/words into industrial action. My attempt with this post is to write a sufficiently complex Go Microservice using ports & adapters architecture (which by the linked article is layers/onion architecture with dependency injection), and keep it as flat as possible.

#### TLDR

Visit [github.com/ghostsquad/go-ports-adapters-spec] for all the code.

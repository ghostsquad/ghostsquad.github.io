Pay attention to the interview process for the company you are looking to join. Do they communicate with you often? Do they provide answers to questions before you even ask them? Do they go out of their way to coordinate calls (phone or video), onsites, and opportunities to talk to leadership at the company? Are they quick to respond, followup, move to the next step?

If the answer to these questions is predominately `no`, chances are the company or team has problems with prioritization. Welcome to the Eisonhower Priority Matrix. Hiring people might be a `strategic goal` for long term scalability and maintainability of the company's core products. But that's only because you can't really predict when the next candidate is going to come in. When they do though, it should be all hands on deck. You're the candidate, you are probably interviewing with multiple companies at the same time. If you aren't, you _really should be_. If a candidate isn't a priority when they do show up, it's usually a combination of lack of agility, and the inability for leadership to prioritize properly. Do you really want to work for a company that says hiring is important, but when there's an opportunity right in from of their face, they can't actually execute?

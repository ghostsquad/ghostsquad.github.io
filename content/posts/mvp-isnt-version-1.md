title: "An MVP isn't Version 1"

This post is heavily inspired by a [post about MVPs by David DeWolf](https://daviddewolf.com/minimum-viable-product/) and [version 1 sucks but ship it anyway by Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/version-1-sucks-but-ship-it-anyway/)

There's a lot in common in these posts, despite what it seems is a polar opposite vibe. The most important thing that you need to keep in mind is this:

> Don't Release Crap

An MVP could be as simple as a mockup, it could also be a facade around manual labor, such as with CardMunch:

> In order to test the market and adoption, CardMunch made the decision to build only the functionality necessary to upload a picture of the business card from your smartphone. Unlike competitors in the space, they manually transcribed the business cards before pushing the results back to the user. Adoption exploded. Within five months they were acquired by LinkedIn and in less than a year they had processed their millionth business card. There was obviously a market.

CardMunch knew full well that manual labor wasn't going to scale, but the also didn't know whether there was market for the business card transcription. They made an MVP to find out.

> A successful MVP will result in one of three outcomes:
>
> * enough information to prove that the idea will not work
> * enough information to accelerate and build the full product
> * enough information to show that there are valid concepts but the idea needs to “pivot.”

If you are going to build an MVP, that's ok. If you have vetted the idea, and are building Version 1, then do that. Don't confuse these things though.

Version 1 does not need to be perfect. Far from it. What it does need to do is work, and not piss people off. It's much better to have 1 feature that works really well, than 10 features that are clunky and unreliable.

> Instead of spending three months fixing up this version in a sterile, isolated lab, you could be spending that same three month period listening to feedback from real live, honest-to-god, annoyingdedicated users of your software. Not the software as you imagined it, and the users as you imagined them, but as they exist in the real world. You can turn around and use that directed, real world feedback to not only fix all the sucky parts of version 1, but spend your whole development budget more efficiently, predicated on hard usage data from your users.

Ok, so you have Version 1 done, and people are using it. Now comes the next step which is entirely missed. Iteration. Releasing Version 1 doesn't mean that you are free to move onto another project, which all too often seems to be the goal.

> What's important isn't so much the initial state of the software – in fact, some say if you aren't embarrassed by v1.0 you didn't release it early enough – but what you do after releasing the software.
>
> The velocity and responsiveness of your team to user feedback will set the tone for your software, far more than any single release ever could. That's what you need to get good at.

I work the SRE/PaaS space, and I often encounter "MVPism" as a tactic to get something working in the hands of customers, and yet, that's not at all the point, and in fact, this is a terrible idea.

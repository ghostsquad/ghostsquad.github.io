I don't know what it is about me, but ideas come to my head often for experiences, mechanics, etc for new boardgames. I have notebooks full of these ideas. I have the hardest time converting these ideas into actual games. I get bogged down in "where's the fun?", how to make something challenging without being punishing. I get bogged down in "world building". I can't seem to let my mind create something that does not or _could_ not realistically exist. I've attempted to mitigate this problem of mine by looking for a partner that might be better at execution of these ideas than I am, but I've been unsuccessful. Frankly, I'm not even sure I really should be trying to do this. Juggling a full-time engineering career, a full-time family, and even just trying to get to the gym on a regular basis is already hard enough. I spend my downtime _engrossed_ in games, not building them.

I think I'm in a waiting pattern right now. Waiting for life to settle down a bit more. The bumps to even out, and the stress to decrease. My hope is that someday I can release a game, it's probably going to be a heavy game, cause that's just me, and that's the kinds of games I really like. Who knows if I'll make any money on it. It will definitely be a cool experience though.

I've learned one important lesson over the years that seems to come up over and over. If you do cool things, and involve yourself in communities where you can talk about the cool things you do, you can meet really cool people, learn about lots of other cool things, and really this cycle continues. This is by far the best way to network.
